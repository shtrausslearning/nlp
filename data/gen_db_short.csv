- <b>learning_rate</b>: The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. Lower  values can improve accuracy, but require more iterations. 
- <b>depth</b>: The depth of the decision tree used in the model. Increasing the depth can improve accuracy, but also increases the risk of overfitting. 
- <b>l2_leaf_reg</b>: The L2 regularization coefficient. Increasing this value can help prevent overfitting. 
- <b>iterations</b>: The number of iterations to run during training. Increasing this value can improve accuracy, but also increases training time.
- <b>random_strength</b>: The amount of randomness to use when selecting splits in the decision tree. Higher values can increase the model's 
- <b>border_count</b>: The number of splits to consider when building a decision tree. Increasing this value can improve accuracy, but also increases training time'
- <b>loss_function</b>: The loss function to optimize during training. For regression tasks, common options include MAE (mean absolute error), RMSE (root mean squared error), and Quantile (for quantile regression).
- <b>task_type</b>: The type of task to perform, either CPU or GPU. Using a GPU can significantly speed up training time. 
- <b>boosting_type</b>: The type of boosting to use, either Plain or Ordered. The Ordered option can be useful for datasets with categorical features. 
- <b>colsample_bylevel</b>: The fraction of features to use at each level of the decision tree.
- <b>min_data_in_leaf</b>: The minimum number of samples required in each leaf node of the decision tree. Increasing this value can help prevent overfitting."

Here are some steps that can help you get started:

[1] <b>Install CatBoost</b>: Install CatBoost if you already haven't in your terminal/cell

pip install catboost

[2] <b>Import CatBoost</b>:

from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

[3] <b>Prepare your data</b>: Before training your model, you need to prepare your data, such as cleaning, preprocessing, splitting your data into subsets and encoding categorical variables if you have any

[4] <b>Train your model</b>: Once you have prepared your data, you can train your model using the <code>CatBoostClassifier()</code> function. Specify hyperparameters such as learning rate, depth, and number of iterations to tune your model. 

Here is an example of how you can train a CatBoost classifier:

<code>
model = CatBoostClassifier(iterations=1000,
                           learning_rate=0.1,
                           depth=6,
                           loss_function='Logloss',
                           verbose=True)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, cat_features=categorical_features_indices)
</code>

[5] <b>Evaluate your model</b>: After training your model, you can evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

[6] <b>Use your model for predictions</b>: Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, you can use it for making predictions on new data using the predict() function.

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
