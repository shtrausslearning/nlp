### Project Keywords 📒

`Sentiment` `Multiclass` `Emotion` `Classification` `NLP` `HuggingFace` `Transformers`

<br>

### Project Background 📥

- The emergence of social media networks/platforms has allowed people to writing posts, sharing photos and videos
- One of those social medial networks is `Twitter`; it is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world
- Twitter has 330 million monthly active users and 500 million tweets sent each day, which makes it an invaluable tool in ML/DL applications
- Understanding the `sentiment` (tone) of tweets is important for a variety of reasons: `business marketing`, `political views`, `behavior analysis`, just to mention a few
- `Emotions` are important in `Sentiment` analysis (not only `positive` & `negative`) as it gives a more detail about a person's opinion about a `topic` or `product`

<br>

### Key Terms ❓

`Sentiment analysis` | **[Section 5](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/natural-language-processing#5-%7C-Sentiment-Analysis)**

>  Identify & classify the sentiments/tones that are expressed in the text source. social media posts are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis, which is useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics

`Tokenisation` | **[Section 1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/natural-language-processing)**

>  Process of breaking up a sequence of text into pieces such as words, keywords, phrases, symbols and other elements called tokens, several types of techniques exist; `character`, `sentence`, `word` & `subword` tokenisation

`Embedding` | **[Section 4](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/natural-language-processing#3-%7C-Advanced-Feature-Generation)**

> An embedding is the mapping of a discrete — categorical — variable or text to a vector of continuous numbers in vecor form

### Kaggle Notebook 📖

Kaggle offer a very neat `ipynb` render, if you'd like to read the notebook on Kaggle, links are provided below:

- **[Twitter Emotion Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/twitter-emotion-classification)**

<br>

### Project Aim 🎯 

- We need to build a model based sentiment analysis tool that will be able to automatically identify emotional states (eg. anger, joy) that people express about your company's product on twitter
- Aside from the standard approach to `validation`, we'll apply the models on some recent `tweet` examples
