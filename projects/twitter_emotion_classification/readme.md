### Project Keywords 📒

`Sentiment` `Multiclass` `Emotion` `Classification` `NLP` `HuggingFace` `Transformers`

### Project Background 📥

- The emergence of social media networks/platforms has allowed people to writing posts, sharing photos and videos
- One of those social medial networks is `Twitter`; it is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world
- Twitter has 330 million monthly active users and 500 million tweets sent each day, which makes it an invaluable tool in ML/DL applications
- Understanding the `sentiment` (tone) of tweets is important for a variety of reasons: `business marketing`, `political views`, `behavior analysis`, just to mention a few
- `Emotions` are important in `Sentiment` analysis (not only `positive` & `negative`) as it gives a more detail about a person's opinion about a `topic` or `product`

### Key Terms ❓

`Sentiment analysis`

>  Identify & classify the sentiments/tones that are expressed in the text source. social media posts are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis, which is useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics

`Tokenisation`

>  Process of breaking up a sequence of text into pieces such as words, keywords, phrases, symbols and other elements called tokens, several types of techniques exist; `character`, `sentence`, `word` & `subword` tokenisation - Check **[Section I](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shtrausslearning/natural-language-processing)**

### Project Aim 🎯 

- We need to build a model based sentiment analysis tool that will be able to automatically identify emotional states (eg. anger, joy) that people express about your company's product on twitter
- Aside from the standard approach to `validation`, we'll apply the models on some recent `tweet` examples

### Target Labels 🏷️
